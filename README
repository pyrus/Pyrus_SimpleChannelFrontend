A simple PEAR channel frontend that does not require a database.

This package provides a simple frontend to a PEAR channel by directly using
the PEAR channel files.

To use, place the PEAR2_SimpleChannelFrontend-0.1.0.phar in the root of your
channel server as index.php, and add an .htaccess file with the following:

<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule . index.php [L]
</IfModule>

For a more customized interface, you can create a config.inc.php file, or
install the package and use the files in the www_dir as a starting point for
a fully customized PEAR channel.
